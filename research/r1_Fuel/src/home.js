        The automatic pricing formula, introduced in March 2024, is supposed to adjust monthly. It was not applied
        between March and September 2026 while global prices doubled. Six months of suppressed adjustment were then
        released in a single Tk 20 move. The volatility people are experiencing is manufactured by the decision to
        freeze &mdash; not by the formula.

        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          The &ldquo;% of income per 50-litre tank&rdquo; index is useful for ranking countries and useless for predicting
          household distress here, because private car ownership in Bangladesh is a top-decile phenomenon. Almost nobody
          in the affected population buys 50 litres of octane. The transmission runs through
          <strong>diesel</strong> (bus fares, freight, irrigation, generators, trawlers), <strong>kerosene</strong>
          &mdash; the most regressive line in the gazette and the least commented on, burned by the poorest households for
          light during 7&ndash;10 hour rural outages &mdash; and <strong>furnace oil</strong>, which sets the electricity tariff.

          BPC asked for Tk 187 diesel and got Tk 135. The flat Tk 20 design <em>over-recovers</em> on petrol, octane and
          kerosene &mdash; taxing the motorcyclist and the kerosene user to partly cross-subsidise diesel &mdash; and still
          leaves diesel Tk 52 short. BPC's working capital was Tk 12,368 crore on 6 September against a stated need of
          Tk 15,000&ndash;20,000 crore, and it has already drained Tk 19,500 crore out of development project accounts.
          <strong>A second hike, or an equivalent duty cut, is near-certain before end-2026.</strong>

        Anyone planning on Tk 135 diesel being the new normal through the Boro season is planning on the wrong number.
        The Tk 20 buys roughly <strong>Tk 700&ndash;750 crore a month</strong> of cash flow <span class="est">est.</span>

          Duties and taxes on diesel were <strong>Tk 32.44 a litre</strong> in August &mdash; about 24% of the new pump
          price. The state collects Tk 32 at the revenue window while losing roughly Tk 69 at the BPC window: a net
          public-sector loss of about Tk 37 a litre <span class="est">est.</span> with a Tk 32 wedge inside it.
          Zeroing the diesel duty would close <strong>62% of the remaining gap</strong> <span class="est">est.</span>
          with no increase in the pump price at all. That it has not been done is a revenue-protection choice, and it

        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          About 70% of irrigation pumps run on diesel; Boro is around 55% of national rice output; peak irrigation is
          December to March, and planting is decided in November. The cost is already incurred; the price effect
          arrives in 2027. This hike adds roughly <strong>Tk 420 per bigha</strong>, the full move since March about
          <strong>Tk 840</strong> &mdash; some <strong>Tk 2,140 crore</strong> across the coming crop
          <span class="est">est.</span> Meanwhile the government held the Boro procurement price at the old level.
          Rising input cost against a fixed output price compresses margin, and margin decides acreage.

          The National Pay Scale was gazetted on 19 September; the hike took effect on the 21st. Roughly 33 lakh public
          employees and pensioners were indexed to inflation &mdash; the first award in eleven years. Roughly 7.5 crore
          private and informal workers were not. National wage growth is 8.05% against 8.26% inflation, so real wages
          were already negative <em>before</em> this hike. That is the honest form of the grievance, and it is also,
          for a researcher, an unusually clean natural split.

        The pay award did not cause the fuel hike &mdash; Hormuz did. It removed the fiscal cushion that would have let

          Factories and shops fire up generators, diesel demand rises precisely when BPC cannot fund October letters of

          <strong>Tk 15&ndash;80 above the regulated price</strong> in rural markets. Tk 135 is a floor, not a ceiling,

        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          It is the mechanism by which a household on Tk 12,000 a month keeps moving through a 38% petrol shock. Around
          21% of battery-rickshaw drivers are ex-farmers &mdash; and farm incomes are being squeezed by the same diesel
          shock. Suppressing the fleet without a substitute would transmit the oil shock to the informal poor far more
          completely than it currently does. <strong>The fix is metering and charging infrastructure, not
          prohibition</strong>: it converts 500 MW&ndash;1 GW of theft into billed revenue, makes the load visible to
          dispatch planning, and leaves the livelihood intact.

        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          Almost every serious funder needs a PhD-holding PI or an institutional host, so that is the binding
          constraint &mdash; ahead of money. A sampling frame, IRB cover, or a senior co-investigator unblocks
          everything downstream. Sociologists, anthropologists and agricultural economists especially: the economics is
          the easy half.

        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          A single 15-minute CATI wave across 1,500 households costs about $9&ndash;12k. It is the one piece that cannot
          be bought later at any price, because after the next hike there is no &ldquo;before&rdquo; left to measure.
          Everything downstream &mdash; the panel, the papers, the policy briefs &mdash; is worth less without it.

        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          A journalist covering the October CPI print. Someone at BIGD, SANEM, CPD or PPRC. A programme officer at a
          funder. A friend who farms. The single most useful thing a reader can do is get this in front of somebody
          deciding what to measure in the next three weeks.
