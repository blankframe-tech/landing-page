      BPC may run out of letter-of-credit funding in <strong>October</strong>, which makes a second hike or a duty cut
      near-certain. A baseline collected after that is not a baseline. <strong>W0 has to be in the field by around
      20 October</strong>; P3 has to be in villages in <strong>November</strong>, before planting. Everything else can slip.
      These two cannot.

        I&rsquo;m [name], an independent researcher in [city] studying how the 21 September fuel price hike, which came
        two days after the National Pay Scale gazette, affects households and informal workers. Because a further

        collect a pre-shock baseline.<br><br>
        I&rsquo;ve drafted a short proposal for a 5-wave household phone panel stratified by public, formal-private and
        informal sector, with an embedded framing experiment on perceived fairness [attach 2-page summary + link].
        Your work on [specific paper] is directly relevant, particularly [one sentence].<br><br>
        Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week? I&rsquo;d value [feedback on the design / a possible
