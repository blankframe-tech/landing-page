    </div>
    <div class="grid g2">
      <div class="card">
        <h3 style="font-size:19px;">The evidence gap is specific, not general</h3>
        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          Fuel subsidy reform fails politically about 70% of the time &mdash; only around 30% of reforms survive twelve
          months, on Mahdavi, Ross and Simoni&rsquo;s 2025 count. The literature explains that mostly through
          <em>perceived fairness</em>, but almost all of the household-level evidence comes from Nigeria, Iran,
          Indonesia and Ecuador. Bangladesh, with 170 million people and a live reform in progress, is close to absent
          from it. Its own 2022 shock produced protests, fare disputes and commentary &mdash; and almost no systematic
          household sociology.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3 style="font-size:19px;">The identification is a gift of timing</h3>
        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          The pay scale was gazetted 19 September; the hike took effect on the 21st. That splits the population by
          occupation two days apart: ~33 lakh public employees indexed to inflation, ~7.5 crore private and informal
          workers not. Relative deprivation is normally very hard to identify cleanly. Here it arrived dated and
          gazetted, and it is <strong>currently unclaimed</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3 style="font-size:19px;">The policy window is open right now</h3>
        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          The government has to choose in the next quarter between another hike, a duty cut, and targeted compensation
          through the Family Card rail. P5 answers the exact question on that table &mdash; whether people prefer
          universal cheap fuel or targeted cash, and what makes them accept either. Evidence delivered in December is
          usable. Evidence delivered in 2028 is history.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3 style="font-size:19px;">The unit costs are small and the leverage is not</h3>
        <p class="muted" style="font-size:15px;margin-top:12px;">
          A completed phone interview costs $4&ndash;6. A discourse paper costs a few thousand dollars because the
          corpus is already built. This is not an expensive programme; it is a cheap one with a hard deadline, which is
          an unusual combination and the reason a small, fast funder can matter more here than a large, slow one.

          A conjoint experiment, n&asymp;2,000, varying fuel price, compensation size, targeting rule, delivery channel
          and who pays. Small if embedded in a P1 wave. It answers the question the government is actually deciding
          this quarter, and it adds Bangladesh to an international literature &mdash; Iran 2010, Indonesia, Nigeria
          2023 &mdash; that currently explains why fuel subsidy reform fails without much South Asian evidence in it.

      Almost every serious funder needs a PhD-holding PI or an institutional host, and every cycle runs slower than
      October. So the honest sequence is: <strong>host first, grant second</strong>. What closes the gap in the
      meantime is commissioned work, a partner&rsquo;s internal funds, or a single individual or foundation deciding
      that a $1,200 baseline is worth more collected than argued about. If that is you, one email changes what gets
      measured.
