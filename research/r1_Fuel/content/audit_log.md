## Part 1 — The originating conversation

This pass began from a prior conversation (another assistant) that the user pasted in. Recorded verbatim in substance, because Pass 1's first job was to check its claims.

### 1.1 User's opening prompt
> "Do an analysis of fuel cost vs avg income of every country"

### 1.2 Prior assistant's response — global fuel affordability framework

Defined **fuel affordability** as the percentage of average monthly income needed for a 50-litre tank, and argued absolute pump price does not determine pain. Four archetypes:

| # | Archetype | Pump price | 50L as % of monthly income | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | High income, high fuel cost (European/Nordic) | $1.90–2.35/L | 2.0–3.5% | Norway, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, UK |
| 2 | High income, low/moderate cost (US & Gulf) | $0.50–1.15/L | 0.8–1.8% | USA, Switzerland, Qatar, UAE, Saudi, Australia |
| 3 | Low/middle income, subsidised pump (State-Buffer) | $0.05–0.75/L | 5–15% | Egypt, Algeria, Iran, Venezuela, Malaysia, Indonesia |
| 4 | Low/middle income, market/taxed pump (High Fuel Stress) | $0.95–1.30/L | 25–60%+ | India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Madagascar, Philippines |

Affordability matrix it provided (all figures `[UNVERIFIED]`, described by the source itself as estimates):

| Country | Fuel price ($/L) | 50L tank ($) | Avg monthly net wage ($) | % of income per 50L |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| United States | 0.95 | 47.50 | 4,400 | 1.1% |
| Switzerland | 2.05 | 102.50 | 6,600 | 1.6% |
| Australia | 1.20 | 60.00 | 3,500 | 1.7% |
| Japan | 1.15 | 57.50 | 2,300 | 2.5% |
| United Kingdom | 1.85 | 92.50 | 3,100 | 3.0% |
| Germany | 1.95 | 97.50 | 3,150 | 3.1% |
| China | 1.15 | 57.50 | 1,100 | 5.2% |
| Brazil | 1.15 | 57.50 | 600 | 9.6% |
| South Africa | 1.25 | 62.50 | 550 | 11.4% |
| India | 1.20 | 60.00 | 400 | 15.0% |
| Pakistan | 1.00 | 50.00 | 160 | 31.3% |
| Nigeria | 0.75 | 37.50 | 110 | 34.1% |
| Madagascar | 1.30 | 65.00 | 105 | 61.9% |

Its three takeaways: the "illusion of cheap gas" (a Nigerian at $0.75/L faces ~30× the strain of an American at $0.95/L); inflation multipliers where 50L exceeds 20% of pay; and subsidy traps (Nigeria pre-reform, Egypt, Sri Lanka) where decoupling from world crude ends in fiscal deficits and devaluation.

### 1.3 User's follow-up — the actual question, and the lived observations
> "Compare to bd and recently the gov increased the fuel price from 145 to 165. The price was 125 a year ago too! Massive spike out of nowhere and gov employees get wage increase (50-200%) but private sector gets nothing. Autorikshas flood the road loadshedding spike too."

Four distinct claims to test — this drove the whole search plan:
1. Price path 125 → 145 → 165 within about a year
2. Government wage increase of 50–200%, nothing for the private sector
3. Autorickshaws flooding the roads
4. Load shedding spiking

### 1.4 Prior assistant's second response — tier placement
Introduced a second benchmark, the **work-time metric** (hours/minutes of labour per litre), and placed Bangladesh at **~31% of average monthly income per 50L tank**, ranking it among the ~20–25 most fuel-stressed of 130+ tracked nations, but "not the single worst." Its tier table `[UNVERIFIED]`:

| Tier | % of monthly income (50L) | Work time per 1L | Representative countries |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top (hyper-affordable) | 0.5–2.0% | 1–4 min | US, Qatar, UAE, Switzerland, Australia |
| Upper middle | 2.0–5.0% | 5–9 min | UK, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea |
| Middle stress | 5.0–15.0% | 10–25 min | China, Brazil, Mexico, India |
| Severe stress | 20.0–35.0% | 40–60 min | **Bangladesh (~31%)**, Pakistan (~31%), Nigeria (~34%), Sri Lanka |
| Extreme fuel poverty | 50% to >100% | 90–200+ min | Madagascar, Malawi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Mozambique |

Also argued: landlocked transport premiums (Malawi fuel $3.00–3.80/L on sub-$100 wages) and post-subsidy shock plus currency collapse (Nigeria) explain the countries worse than Bangladesh. And for Bangladesh specifically — regional outlier in South Asia at roughly double India's ~15%; private four-wheeler use restricted to the top income decile; secondary transmission through diesel freight, logistics and backup generation into food prices and transit fares.

### 1.5 The user's final instruction
> "FROM THIS FIND OUT HOW TO RECENT SPIKE TO 145 then 165 taka for fuel in bd is gonna effect BD."

**Judgment made at the start of this pass:** the inherited affordability numbers are estimates of unstated provenance, and the Bangladesh figure in particular rests on a wage denominator that was never disclosed. Pass 1 therefore verifies the event first, then rebuilds the affordability arithmetic with explicit, cited denominators, then works the transmission channels. Every inherited number is treated as a hypothesis, not an input.

## Part 2 — Search log

14 web searches and 5 targeted page fetches. Queries recorded verbatim.

### S1. `Bangladesh fuel price increase 165 taka octane petrol 2026`
Confirmed the event. All four products +Tk 20/L. Octane 145→165, petrol 140→160, kerosene 135→155, diesel 115→135 (+17.4%). Effective midnight 21 September 2026. Reasons given: international prices more than doubled since March 2026; freight up on regional instability; BPC losses Tk 228.76bn (US$1.9bn) March–August; hike expected to cut annual losses ~Tk 100bn, conserve FX, curb smuggling to neighbours. Follows hikes in April and June.

### S2. `Bangladesh BPC fuel price September 2026 diesel octane petrol per litre`
Cross-confirmed. Prices held at diesel 115 / octane 145 / petrol 140 / kerosene 135 from 1–20 September, then stepped on the 21st. Gave the clean before/after table.

### S3. `Bangladesh fuel price hike April June 2026 diesel octane price history timeline`
Built the price path. **April 18, 2026:** diesel +15 → 115, octane +20 → 140, petrol +19 → 135, kerosene +18 → 130 (called a record high at the time). **June 2026:** all except diesel +5 → octane 145, petrol 140, kerosene 135. Confirmed the **automatic pricing mechanism introduced 2024**, adjusting periodically on international trends, exchange rate and import cost. *This search is what let the pre-April baseline be back-computed — see D1.*

### S4. `Bangladesh inflation rate 2026 food inflation BBS August 2026`
August 2026 (BBS): general **8.26%** (second consecutive monthly easing, from 8.32% in July); food **7.02%** (from 7.16%); non-food **9.32%** (up from 9.28%). Month-on-month general index +2.31%, food +3.86%.

### S5. `Bangladesh government pay scale increase 2026 salary hike public employees`
Largest civil service pay rise since independence. Grades 1–10 basic up to **+100%**; grades 11–20 up to **+142%**. Lowest basic Tk 8,250 → **20,000**; highest Tk 78,000 → **1,56,000**. **24 lakh employees + 9 lakh pensioners**; first award in 11 years. Cost **Tk 1,05,580 crore**. Phased over three years — 50% of the basic increase in year one, remainder in year two, house rent and allowances in year three. New: Tk 3,000/month disabled-child allowance; mobile allowance extended to all 20 grades. **Confirms user claim #2 on the government side.**

### S6. `Bangladesh loadshedding 2026 power crisis furnace oil diesel electricity generation gas shortage`
**Confirms user claim #4.** Most serious electricity crisis since the government took office in February 2026. Gas supply at a **16-year low** in July–August 2026; daily load shedding exceeded **3,500 MW** at peak. Grid needs ~3,800 mmcfd, got about half. Gas plants: 12,200 MW capacity producing max 5,200 MW. PDB covering the gap with ~**3,000 MW of furnace oil** plus diesel peakers at peak hours. **71 of 143 power plants** idle or well below capacity. Rural consumers 7–8 hrs of cuts daily, some up to 10; rural co-ops serving ~40 million people absorbed ~3,000 MW of the cuts while Dhaka fared better. Causes: Moheshkhali LNG terminal fire (21 July), rough seas idling the second floater, declining domestic gas, and **QatarEnergy force majeure after Hormuz strikes — Qatar had supplied ~60% of LNG**.

### S7. `Brent crude oil price September 2026 Hormuz war oil shock price per barrel`
The upstream cause. Brent $92.30 (1 Sep) → $99.05 → $101.21 (highest close since 22 May) → **$103.87 (18 Sep)**. **Hormuz throughput collapsed 21.6 → 4.9 mbd between Q4 2025 and Q2 2026, −77%.** East-West Crude Oil Pipeline shutdown 11 September. Goldman: Brent could exceed **$120 in 2027** if Gulf output stays 4 mbd below prewar.

### S8. `Bangladesh taka exchange rate dollar 2026 foreign exchange reserves import bill oil`
USD/BDT **123.03** (8 Sep 2026); 2026 average 122.69, range 121.10–124.02; taka −1.09% over 12 months. Reserves **$29.47bn** (IMF BPM6 method); gross reserves $35.1bn in February. Bangladesh Bank bought **$4.3bn** from the interbank market this fiscal year.

### S9. `Bangladesh bus fare increase 2026 transport fare hike after fuel price CNG`
The April precedent, which became the pass-through benchmark. Bus fares **+11 paisa/km**: Dhaka/Chattogram metro Tk 2.45 → **2.56**; 52-seat inter-district Tk 2.12 → **2.23**. Owners demanded **28 paisa**, citing maintenance and the dollar; government limited it to 11 "considering public interest." **Diesel buses only — CNG fares unchanged.** Fares to adjust automatically with fuel prices in future. Launch fares raised up to **18 paisa/km**. Separately: "bus fares surge unchecked" after the hike, and a 2022 precedent of fares raised **as much as 22%** after a record hike.

### S10. `Bangladesh battery run rickshaw autorickshaw 2026 flood roads unemployment Dhaka`
**Confirms user claim #3.** **97%** of battery rickshaws and ~86% of pedal rickshaws unregistered. Innovision survey: **21.35% of battery rickshaw drivers were previously farmers** — the largest occupational group. Battery cost may force fleet reductions and significant unemployment. Government considering relocating them outside metropolitan areas to fix traffic "without creating new unemployment."

### S11. `battery run rickshaw electricity consumption Bangladesh megawatt charging load estimate crore units`
The grid-load link. Estimates vary by source: ~500 MW daily for ~60 lakh vehicles; **CPD: e-three-wheelers ≈ 5% of total national generation, ~750 MW**; another range **800 MW–1 GW ≈ 5% of generation**. Per vehicle 4–9 kWh/day. In Dhaka: **3,300 authorised charging stations versus ~48,136 illegal charging points.** August 2026: government **mandated solar charging** for millions of electric rickshaws.

### S12. `Bangladesh average monthly income labour force survey BBS per capita income 2026 median wage taka`
The denominators the inherited 31% lacked. Average gross monthly salary **Tk 18,000 (~$149)**; **median monthly income Tk 9,000 (~$75)**; minimum wage **Tk 12,500** (since 1 Dec 2023). GDP per capita $2,960 nominal / $10,850 PPP (2026 est.). Labour force 77.36 million (2024).

### S13. `Bangladesh furnace oil price 2026 power generation cost per unit diesel peaking plant taka kWh`
The fuel nobody was discussing. **Furnace oil Tk 70.10 → 94.69 (April, +Tk 24) → 113.54 (May).** Private oil-fired plants received capacity payments of **BDT 9.5/kWh** in FY2024-25. Average generation cost rose BDT 6.61 → 11.33/kWh between FY2020-21 and FY2022-23. Bangladesh runs **10.7% of generation on oil** versus India 0.02%, Pakistan 0.6%, Vietnam 0.06%. Government spending ~**Tk 1.2bn/day** on fuel-oil generation.

### S14. `Bangladesh private sector wage growth 2026 real wages minimum wage garment workers inflation`
The other half of user claim #2. RMG minimum wage **Tk 12,500**, +56% from Tk 8,000, set December 2023 after protests; **9% annual increment**. **No fixed increment system in the private sector** — employer discretion. **National wage growth 8.05% against 8.26% inflation → real wages negative.** Garment wages "barely increased since 2019" in real terms. Minimum wage adequate rurally, short of urban (especially Dhaka) cost of living.

### S15. `Bangladesh fuel price hike protest reaction September 2026 opposition Tarique Rahman government criticism`
Political constraint. **PM Tarique Rahman publicly apologised over the electricity and fuel crisis on 5 September and warned against anarchy**; said the government is open to opposition input. **Second fuel hike since the BNP government took office in February 2026.** Energy division statement: "the ongoing war in the Middle East has caused a significant increase in the international prices of all types of petroleum products and freight charges since March 2026, and the upward trend continues." Global context: fuel-price protests across multiple countries mid-September (CNN, 15 Sep). Government to be "tougher against fuel hoarding, smuggling."

### S16. `Bangladesh GDP growth forecast 2026 revised 3.9% job losses remittances Gulf crisis returning migrants`
Macro damage. **FY2025-26 GDP growth cut from 4.6% to 3.9%** on the Middle East conflict plus domestic fragilities. **Gulf states ≈ 3.0% of GDP in remittances ≈ 50% of total inflows.** Poverty exits cut from **1.7 million to 0.5 million** in FY2026. **Real wages already negative for low-income and unskilled workers across agriculture, industry and services.**

### S17. `Bangladesh diesel irrigation boro season cost farmers 2026 agriculture subsidy`
The largest forward-looking channel. Boro irrigation **Tk 3,500–4,000/bigha**, hitting **Tk 6,000** during fuel shortages in Chuadanga. **~15 lakh shallow tube wells** run on diesel. Diesel reportedly sold **Tk 15–80/L above regulated price** in some regions. **Boro is >55% of total rice production, ~21–22 million tonnes.** Existing mechanisation subsidies (70% haor / 50% elsewhere) cover combine harvesters, not diesel. Experts calling for direct cash support.

### S18. `Bangladesh garment RMG factories diesel generator cost 2026 export competitiveness energy crisis production loss`
Export channel. Factories paying a **Tk 10/L premium** for generator diesel; some burning up to **$25,000/day (Tk 30 lakh)** on alternative fuels; smaller units ~**Tk 40,000/day** with 3–4 hours of outages. **Production capacity down 20–30%**; knit composite and woven washing plants at **50% or less**. Risk of losing orders to India, Pakistan, Vietnam.

### S19. `Bangladesh LDC graduation November 2026 duty free access RMG exports impact`
The collision date. **Graduation 24 November 2026.** LDC status currently gives duty-free access to EU, UK, Canada, Japan covering **75–78% of exports**; RMG is >80% of export earnings and 4m+ workers. Post-transition tariffs **9–12% EU, 7–13% Japan, 16–18% Canada**; estimated **6–14% drop in export earnings, $1–7bn/yr** (WTO warning of up to $8bn ≈ 14% of exports). **EU/UK/Canada grace periods to November 2029.**

### S20. `Bangladesh BPC losses subsidy 2026 fuel smuggling India automatic pricing formula next adjustment`
BPC mechanics. Losses **Tk 22,875.66 crore March–August 2026**, driven by global prices rising without domestic adjustment — **the automatic formula exists but was not applied after March.** India's prices are deliberately built into the formula to deter cross-border smuggling. Formula components: import cost at the payment-day exchange rate, plus customs tax, dealer commission, BPC development cost, operating expense, transport, and a small margin; **monthly** adjustment. Precedent exists for cuts (Tk 2/L reduction under the formula).

### Fetch F1 — Daily Star, "Fuel prices hiked by Tk 20 a litre"
Prices, effective date, April comparison. Notably contained **no** rationale, BPC figures, impact estimate, official quotes, or mention of transport/irrigation/power effects — pure price reporting. Recorded because the absence is itself informative about the announcement's framing.

### Fetch F2 — Daily Star, "Fuel price hike lays bare stress on economy" (April)
The April analogue, used to calibrate expectations. Energy Minister Iqbal Hassan Mahmood Tuku: "Fuel must be purchased with foreign currency. By increasing prices slightly, we are trying to keep the situation at a 'tolerable level.'" Transport associations proposed city fare rises **up to 64%** and long-distance up to Tk 3.80/km; waterways proposed **36–42%**. Agricultural economist **Jahangir Alam Khan**: severe Boro risk at peak irrigation demand, threatening yields across irrigation, harvesting, transport and marketing. **Prof Mustafizur Rahman (CPD)**: will "erode purchasing power after prolonged inflation, while raising costs across transport, industry, and trade." **Zahid Hussain (ex-World Bank)** supported the adjustment — subsidies "drained public funds and disproportionately benefited wealthier groups." BPC raised supply targets from 20 April: diesel +17.5%, octane +25.9%, petrol +20.6%.

### Fetch F3 — Daily Star, "BPC may run out of funds for fuel imports in Oct" ⚠️ **the decisive find**
- Working capital **Tk 12,368 crore** (6 September) — enough for September import payments only
- Stated minimum need **Tk 15,000–20,000 crore** (two months of imports)
- Accumulated losses March–August **Tk 22,876 crore**
- **August import spend Tk 7,603 crore versus Tk 2,741 crore the same month a year earlier (+177%)**
- August duties/taxes on diesel: **Tk 32.44/litre**
- Already withdrawn **Tk 19,500 crore** from development project accounts; **Tk 1,679.72 crore** left
- Further obligations: Tk 524 crore (September, LPG tank land), Tk 690 crore by December (Single Point Mooring), Tk 3,500 crore development costs through December
- **BPC's own proposed September prices vs what the government set: diesel Tk 187 vs 135; petrol 150 vs 160; octane 154 vs 165; kerosene 146 vs 155**
- **October 2026: risks exhausting funds for opening letters of credit**
- State Minister for Energy Aninda Islam Amit: "The government is treating all matters related to ensuring uninterrupted fuel imports as a priority." BPC "does not expect the funding crunch to disrupt fuel supplies immediately."

### Fetch F4 — TBS, "Fuel prices hiked by Tk20 per litre"
Percentages: diesel **17.4%**, petrol **14.3%**, octane **13.8%**, kerosene **14.8%**. Government kept prices through August "despite doubling international costs." Rationale: reduce BPC losses, prevent smuggling, maintain electricity and gas subsidies. **BPC loss Tk 89/L on diesel; ~Tk 109 crore/day; ~Tk 40,000 crore/year annualised; hike saves ~Tk 10,000 crore/year.** Regional diesel comparison: **Bangladesh 135, India 134.76, Myanmar 164.83, Nepal 161.24, Pakistan 185.48.** Reactions — **Dr Fahmida Khatun (CPD)**: "wide-ranging consequences," transport costs into food prices, disproportionate burden on the poor. **Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez (BCI)**: "more than 15% increase without consulting anyone," intensified inflation, reduced export competitiveness. **Shams Mahmud (Bangladesh-Thai Chamber)**: necessary buffering but adds inflationary pressure on already-weakening export industries. **No statement on further hikes, rationing or supply restrictions.**

### Fetch F5 — CPD, Fahmida Khatun on the hike
"Substantial policy intervention, especially when inflation and household financial pressure are already high"; may "intensify inflation, reduce household consumption and weaken growth." Lower-income families disproportionately burdened. **Irrigation: 70% of pumps diesel.** Manufacturing hit on generators and logistics; small businesses most vulnerable. Recommendations: disclose the price calculation transparently, prevent excessive fare rises and market manipulation, targeted support for low-income households, small farmers and public transport users. **No quantified projections offered** — which is why Part 4 builds its own.

### Fetch F6 — Daily Star editorial, "Hurrah for some, pain for many"
The distributional case. 24 lakh employees and 9 lakh pensioners gain after an 11-year freeze; the general population bears inflation and reduced public services because the government lacks revenue and must borrow. **Implementation cost Tk 1,05,580 crore. Last year's tax revenue shortfall Tk 88,000 crore against a Tk 5,03,000 crore target. Projected job losses from regional instability: 6,00,000. Growth forecast cut 4.5% → 3.9%.** Contains **no** private-sector wage data — only a suggestion that the private sector "align its pay structures without putting additional strain on the economy." *Noted as a gap the log fills from S14.*

### Fetch F7 — search on mitigation measures
**Family Card**: digital social safety-net programme launched by the Ministry of Social Welfare **10 March 2026**, unifying poor and low-income families in one database for direct financial and food assistance. Cash transfers/vouchers suggested as the effective instrument. No TCB/OMS measures found tied to this specific hike. World Bank has a fuel-market-volatility support factsheet (May 2026).

## Part 4 — Derived calculations

Every number in `impact_analysis.md` marked `[est.]` is defined here.

**D1 — Pre-April baseline prices.** April hike deltas subtracted from April levels: diesel 115−15=**100**; petrol 135−19=**116**; octane 140−20=**120**; kerosene 130−18=**112**. → Cumulative since March: diesel **+35.0%**, petrol **+37.9%**, octane **+37.5%**, kerosene **+38.4%**. *Note: the user recalled octane at 125 a year ago; 120 is the immediate pre-April level. Both are consistent with a formula drifting in the 120–131 band through 2025. Octane 125 → 165 = +32% year-on-year.*

**D2 — 50L octane affordability.** 50 × 165 = Tk 8,250 = **$67.07** at 123.0 BDT/USD.
- ÷ 18,000 avg gross = **45.8%**
- ÷ 12,500 RMG minimum = **66.0%**
- ÷ 20,000 new govt lowest basic (fully phased) = **41.3%**
- ÷ 9,000 median = **91.7%**
- A year ago at Tk 125: 6,250 ÷ 18,000 = **34.7%**
- *Reconciliation of the inherited 31%:* 8,250 ÷ 0.31 implies a monthly wage of **Tk 26,600 (~$216)** — above Bangladesh's average gross salary and roughly 3× the median. The inherited figure was not wrong so much as computed against an undisclosed and unrepresentative denominator.

**D3 — Work-time per litre.** At 208 hrs/month: avg wage Tk 86.54/hr → 165 ÷ 86.54 = **1.91 hrs = 1h 54m**. Median Tk 43.27/hr → **3.81 hrs = 3h 49m**. RMG Tk 60.10/hr → **2h 45m**. Diesel at avg wage: 135 ÷ 86.54 = **1.56 hrs = 94 min**. → Places Bangladesh in the inherited table's *Extreme Fuel Poverty* band (90–200+ min/L), not *Severe Stress* (40–60 min).

**D4 — Diesel gap closure.** BPC formula price 187 − pre-hike 115 = **Tk 72 gap**; Tk 20 passed = **27.8% closed**; **Tk 52 remaining**. Note the flat Tk 20 *over*-recovers on petrol (160 vs 150 proposed), octane (165 vs 154) and kerosene (155 vs 146) — a cross-subsidy from those three to diesel that still leaves diesel short.

**D5 — Diesel volume and saving cross-check.** Implied throughput = 109 crore/day ÷ Tk 89/L = **~12.2 mn L/day**. Saving = 20 × 12.24m × 365 = **~Tk 8,900 crore/yr** against the government's claimed ~Tk 10,000 crore. ✓ Internally consistent, which corroborates the reported loss figures. Post-hike loss = 89 − 20 = **Tk 69/L**; daily **~Tk 85 crore**; annualised **~Tk 31,000 crore**. Monthly cash relief ~Tk 730 crore against a ~Tk 3,800 crore/month loss run-rate (22,876 ÷ 6).

**D6 — The duty wedge.** Tk 32.44 of the Tk 135 pump price = **24.0%**. Net public-sector position per litre: NBR collects 32.44, BPC loses 69 → **net −Tk 36.56/L**. Zeroing the duty would close 32.44 ÷ 52 = **62.4% of the remaining gap** with no pump-price rise.

**D7 — Inflation decomposition** `[ASSUMED]` weights, standard for the Bangladesh CPI basket:
| Channel | Assumption | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Direct fuel purchase | 1.5–2.5% weight × ~15% price rise | +0.25 to +0.40 pp |
| Transport services | 5–6% weight × 8–15% realised fare rise | +0.40 to +0.90 pp |
| Food via freight + irrigation | 46% food weight × 0.8–1.4% cost pass-through | +0.40 to +0.65 pp |
| **Cost-push subtotal** | | **+1.05 to +1.95 pp** |
| Pay-scale demand injection | ~Tk 30–35k crore ≈ 0.55% of GDP | +0.30 to +0.50 pp |
→ From 8.26%, expect **9.5–10.5% by Dec 2026–Jan 2027**, non-food leading to ~10.5–11%, food re-accelerating on a lag. The two-month easing trend breaks in the October or November print.

**D8 — GDP denominator for D7.** $2,960 per capita × ~175m = **~$518bn ≈ Tk 63.7 lakh crore**. Year-one pay injection Tk 30–35k crore = **0.47–0.55% of GDP**.

**D9 — Bus fare pass-through.** April: diesel +15.0% → gazetted metro fare +4.49% (2.45→2.56). **Ratio 0.30.** Applied to +17.4%: +5.2% → metro **Tk 2.69/km**, inter-district **Tk 2.35/km**. Commuter effect, 20 km/day round trip: gazetted +Tk 2.6/day ≈ **Tk 60/month**; but a minimum-fare round-up from Tk 10 to 15 on two legs × 22 working days = **Tk 220–300/month** ≈ **1.8–2.4% of an RMG wage**. Realised overshoot is the documented pattern (S9: "surge unchecked"; 2022: up to 22%).

**D10 — Irrigation cost.** Diesel ≈ 60–70% of the Tk 3,500–4,000/bigha baseline ≈ Tk 2,400. This hike: +17.4% × 2,400 = **+Tk 418/bigha ≈ +Tk 1,254/acre** (3 bigha/acre). Since March: +35% × 2,400 = **+Tk 840/bigha ≈ +Tk 2,520/acre**. Boro area ~4.9m ha = 12.1m acres; ~70% diesel-irrigated = **8.47m acres**. Aggregate: **~Tk 1,060 crore from this hike; ~Tk 2,130 crore since March.** Per kg of rice: diesel-irrigation ≈ Tk 3–4 of Tk 32–35/kg production cost; +35% = **+Tk 1.05–1.40/kg**.

**D11 — Generator costs.** Effective factory diesel = 135 + 10 premium = **Tk 145/L**. A unit reported at Tk 40,000/day scales to **~Tk 47,000/day** (+17.4%); one at $25,000/day → **~$29,300/day**.

**D12 — Freight.** 15t truck, Dhaka–Chattogram 250 km at ~3 km/L = 83.3 L one way × Tk 20 = **+Tk 1,667/trip** ≈ 6% of a Tk 25,000–30,000 charter. Realised rate rise **8–12%** once empty return legs and driver costs compound.

**D13 — e-3W versus liquid fuel, per km.** Petrol 3W at Tk 165/L and ~15 km/L = **Tk 11.00/km**. Battery 3W drawing 4–9 kWh/day over ~100 km at Tk 8–9/kWh = 0.04–0.09 kWh/km = **Tk 0.32–0.81/km**. Ratio **~14–34×**; for the 93% of Dhaka charging points that are illegal, the operator's marginal cost is **~0**. The hike widened an already decisive wedge by another 13.8%.

**D14 — Forex.** August import spend Tk 7,603 crore ÷ 123 = **$618m/month** vs Tk 2,741 crore = **$223m** a year earlier. Increment **$395m/month ≈ $4.74bn/yr ≈ 16.1% of the $29.47bn reserve stock.** Demand destruction at short-run price elasticity −0.1 to −0.2 `[ASSUMED]` → volume −1.7 to −3.5% → **~$150–250m/yr saved**. Real but second-order against a $4.74bn increment.

**D15 — Smuggling arbitrage.** Pre-hike: India 134.76 − Bangladesh 115 = **Tk 19.76/L** incentive to move subsidised diesel out. Post-hike: 134.76 − 135 = **−Tk 0.24/L**. Arbitrage eliminated. This rationale is sound.

**D16 — Wage wedge.** Year-one phased grade-20 basic = 8,250 + 50% × (20,000 − 8,250) = **Tk 14,125** (+71%, reaching +142% by year two). RMG worker: **Tk 12,500**, +0% since Dec 2023 (9%/yr increment aside). Against ~30% cumulative inflation since 2023 `[ASSUMED]`, the first is real-positive and the second sharply real-negative. Covered population 33 lakh ≈ **2% of population, ~4% of the 77.4m labour force**.

## Part 5 — Findings against the four original claims

| # | User's claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "145 to 165, was 125 a year ago" | **Confirmed** | Octane 145→165 on 21 Sep; ~120–125 a year ago. +32% YoY, +37.5% since March |
| 2 | "Govt +50–200%, private nothing" | **Confirmed, magnitude slightly overstated at the top** | Grades 1–10 up to +100%, grades 11–20 up to +142% (not 200%); private sector has no mechanism, real wages negative (8.05% growth vs 8.26% inflation) |
| 3 | "Autorickshaws flood the road" | **Confirmed, and causally linked** | Operating cost 14–34× cheaper per km (D13); 97% unregistered; fleet draws 5% of national generation |
| 4 | "Load shedding spike" | **Confirmed, and part of the same loop** | >3,500 MW peak cuts; gas at 16-year low; e-3W charging 500 MW–1 GW on 48,136 illegal Dhaka points |
| — | "Out of nowhere" | **Partly rejected** | The shock is external (Hormuz) and was flagged since March. What was "sudden" is the *policy*: the monthly formula was suspended March–September, then six months of adjustment released in one Tk 20 step |

**The finding that mattered most, and was not in the originating conversation at all:** BPC asked for Tk 187 diesel and got Tk 135, leaving **Tk 52/L unpassed with only 27.8% of the gap closed**, while its working capital covers September only and **LC funding may be exhausted in October**. Tk 20 is roughly a quarter of the adjustment, not the end of it.

---

## Part 6 — Open questions for Pass 2

1. Actual BBS CPI basket weights for fuel, transport and food — D7 uses assumed weights and is the least firm calculation in the set.
2. Diesel volume split: irrigation vs freight vs generators vs power. Would sharpen D10/D11/D12 considerably.
3. Whether the diesel duty cut (D6) is under active consideration — no reporting found either way.
4. Gazetted bus fare revision after this hike — not yet published at the time of this pass; D9 is a forecast to be scored.
5. Boro acreage intentions for 2026-27 — the single most important unknown for 2027 food inflation.
6. Real-wage series for informal workers specifically, not the national aggregate.
7. Whether the Family Card rail is actually being used for fuel compensation.
8. e-3W fleet size: estimates range from 500,000 to 6,000,000 across sources. The load estimates rest on this and the range is unacceptably wide.
